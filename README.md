## Bag of Words Implementation with Text Preprocessing

### Features

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: The main feature of this implementation is the BoW model, which represents each document as a vector of word counts.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Prior to constructing the BoW model, the text data undergoes several preprocessing steps to enhance its quality and relevance for analysis.
    - **Tokenization**: The text is tokenized into individual words or tokens using the NLTK library.
    - **Stop Word Removal**: Common stop words, such as "the", "and", and "is", are removed from the text to focus on meaningful content.
    - **Stemming**: Words are stemmed to their root forms using the NLTK Porter Stemmer, reducing inflected words to their base or root form.
    - **Lemmatization**: Additionally, lemmatization is applied to reduce words to their canonical or dictionary form, ensuring consistency in representation.
